    <p title="Hello There">Mahendra Singh Dhoni, popularly known as MS Dhoni, is one of the greatest cricketers in the
        history of Indian cricket. Born on July 7, 1981, in Ranchi, Jharkhand, Dhoni’s journey from a small-town boy to
        the captain of the Indian cricket team is nothing short of inspiring. Known for his calm demeanor, sharp
        cricketing brain, and extraordinary leadership skills, Dhoni has left an indelible mark on the sport.

        Dhoni made his international debut in December 2004 in an ODI against Bangladesh. Although he did not perform
        well in his first few matches, he soon gained attention with his blistering knock of 148 against Pakistan. His
        powerful hitting, combined with his ability to finish games, quickly made him a key player in the Indian team.
        In 2007, Dhoni was appointed the captain of the Indian T20 team for the inaugural ICC T20 World Cup. Under his
        leadership, India clinched the T20 World Cup title, marking the beginning of a glorious era.

        One of Dhoni's greatest achievements came in 2011 when he led India to victory in the ICC Cricket World Cup. His
        unforgettable six over long-on in the final against Sri Lanka sealed India’s triumph, ending a 28-year World Cup
        drought. Dhoni's leadership was marked by his strategic brilliance, cool-headedness under pressure, and
        exceptional decision-making skills. He was also known for his effective use of the Decision Review System (DRS),
        earning him the nickname "Captain Cool."

        Apart from his leadership, Dhoni was a remarkable wicketkeeper. With lightning-fast stumpings and sharp catches,
        he revolutionized the role of a wicketkeeper-batsman. His unorthodox yet effective style made him one of the
        finest finishers in cricket history. Dhoni’s ability to read the game and take calculated risks made him a
        master tactician.

        In August 2020, Dhoni announced his retirement from international cricket, leaving behind a legacy of unmatched
        achievements. However, he continues to play in the Indian Premier League (IPL) for Chennai Super Kings (CSK),
        where he remains an influential figure. Under his captaincy, CSK has won multiple IPL titles, further cementing
        his legacy.
